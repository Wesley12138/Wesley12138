### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Wesley12138.Wesley12138&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)

I have completed my MSc study of Computational Statistics and Machine Learning 🎓 at University College London 🏛. The past years’ training has equipped me with a solid foundation in machine learning, and further stimulate my inner interest 💡 in the research of Natural Language Processing ✨.

Like challenges and solving problems, and hope to achieve something significant; endlessly curious and seeking to extend my knowledge; can work with others in a team, but equally happy to concentrate on problems on my own.
